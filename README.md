# Week 3 Remediation – Battle Rap Analysis Portfolio

This project is a web-based remediation of an academic paper I wrote for my Battle Rap class. The original essay explored the rhetorical strategies, audience impact, and production elements of Roxanne Shanté’s “Roxanne’s Revenge.”

## Content Breakdown
The site is divided into four sections:
- **Home (index.html):** Introduces the central theme and research question.
- **Audience (audience.html):** Explores how the track impacted different listener groups.
- **Strategies (strategies.html):** Highlights rhetorical tools and lyrical techniques.
- **Production (production.html):** Examines sonic structure, sampling, and beat choices.

## Adaptation Choices
- Rewrote content for a general audience (less academic, more accessible)
- Split long paragraphs into scannable web sections
- Used HTML5 semantic tags for structure and hierarchy
- Applied responsive design principles for mobile-first layout

This site is the foundation for my final portfolio. In Week 4, I will enhance the design, add visual elements, and improve accessibility.
